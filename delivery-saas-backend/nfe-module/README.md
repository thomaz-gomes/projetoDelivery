# nfe-module (moved into delivery-saas-backend)

This module implements a minimal NFC-e generate/sign/send skeleton.

It was moved into `delivery-saas-backend/nfe-module` to simplify integration with the backend.

Keep `package.json` if you want to build or run the module independently (`cd delivery-saas-backend/nfe-module && npm install`).
